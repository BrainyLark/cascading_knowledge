# Unidirectional Cascade on FAQ Cache

> E.B. Rationale underpinning implementation decisions I made over service development stages.

### Premise

#### 1.1 Objective

Create a service that tracks an update down on the documents in a specified directory, update the vector database collection A with it and subsequently update the cached responses to the frequently asked questions B in the same database in an embedded form.

#### 1.2 Scope

There exist in the vector database a collection of 8170 faq 4-tuples with duplicate records present. A 4-tuple is composed of 2 text properties for the question and the response, whilst the remaining two arrays correspond to their vectorizations. Simultaneously, in a different collection, approximately 300 chunks are embedded into vectors. The flow of cascading effect takes place from the latter to the former, never the other way around.

### Plan

The following table illustrates task descriptions needed to complete the service. The tasks are broken down into broader categories of *setup*, *regulation handling*, *cascade handling* and *response regeneration*. The status of a task is either completed (游릭), found obsolete (游댮), ongoing (游댯) and planned (游리). Some tasks are accomplished but found obsolete (i.e. 游릭游댮). This is to certify a portion of my time went into the task despite its uselessness at the moment.

| Category      | Task                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Status |

| Setup         | 1.1 Set up database            | Started a local Weaviate server. Used a client to create the two collections of schemas in the aforementioned criterion. Both text and vectorization are stored altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 游릭     |
| Setup         | 1.2 Populate database (FAQ)    | Batched the QA pairs with their vectorization counterparts (through batch encoding of both questions and responses) in two hundreds and submitted them to the faq collection. (p.s. QA Data could have been cleaner, sentences with a lot of special characters caused so much delay and unnecessary computing loads in CPU in the course of batch encoding. Enough for me to reduce the batch size to 10 to avoid getting my insertion process killed.) | 游릭     |
| Setup         | 1.3 Populate database (chunks) | Used Langchain's HTML parser in addition to Recursive text splitters to create chunks with the length of 1500 chars and the overlap of 100 chars. Chunks are saved in terms of content, id, filepath, index and last modified date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 游릭     |
| Chunk manager | 2.1.a Listen to update         | Created a watchdog listener to the directory of regulation documents regarding Golomt policies. However, it turned obsolete due to rearrangement of all the chunks related to the tampered file. This was done through deleting all the chunks in the collection and creating chunks anew out of the updated document and inserting them again.                                                                                                          | 游릭游댮   |
| Chunk manager | 2.1.b Chunk hashing            | An incoming html document is loaded through unstructured html reader and split into chunks through the recursive text splitter and hashed with md5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 游릭     |
| Chunk manager | 2.2 Chunk update               | For a document, the existing chunks and coming chunks are compared in their hashes alone, working out two lists: chunks to delete and chunks to add.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 游릭     |
| Chunk manager | 2.3 Chunk persistence          | A function to delete the chunks not present in the new chunks, and add the chunks defined by the new document hashes that were not present in the database apriori.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 游릭     |

| QA manager    | 3.1 Identify Q'                | Q' is a set of queries subject to change in light of updates on the document chunks. This is planned to be carried out reading query by query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 游리     |
| QA manager    | 3.2 Update Q' responses        | On account of Golomt policy chunks inserted anew and deleted, each query in Q' has their response regenerated through an LLM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 游리     |
| QA manager    | 3.3 Connect modules            | Make the QA database collection contingent on the policy chunk collection, such that as soon as the chunks are updated the identification of Q' starts and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 游리     |
